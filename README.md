  2. Put all the file of the game folder of the repo inside the game folder of your DDLCtVN installation. If the installation is fresh, nothing should be asked to be replaced
  3. Configure Renpy to point unto the folder where the your DDLCtVN is (preferences => Projects Directory)

Troubleshooting :

You may have an error while lauching the mod the first time stating that label are defined twice. This is due to the fact that we are using the whole DDLCtVN 1.5 archive which contain files that we are editing, making them sort of duplicated. This error while be fixed at the released when everything will be repack into a single archive.

For now, the way to make it work is to hit the "Reload" button in the error screen and it should be ok
