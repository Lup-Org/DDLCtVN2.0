            mc "I rarely see you this… well, actually happy."
            s "... but I’m always happy."
            mc "Correction: you’re always positive!"
            mc "And that is really great!"
            mc "But there’s a difference between happy and positive,"

            s "I guess you’re right!"
            s "And to answer your question, I suppose I’m happy for a few reasons…"
            s "The main one is I’m so proud of myself for everything last night…"
            mc "As you should be, Sayori!"
            mc "You did awesome!"
            s "It took a lot of preparation you know!"
            mc "I could tell, it was really something"
            mc "How did you manage all that?"
            s "Well…"
            s "I had some help… hehe "
            "Before I have time to ask questions, the bell rings."
            "Sayori and I hug, and go to our separate classes."
    
    "Ughh…"
    "School is finally over."
    "Time for the Literature club!" 

    "I show up at the clubroom a little early."
    "But it looks like Monika and Natsuki are here as well."
    "I swing open the doors and walk in cheerfully."
    "Monika is the first to greet me."
    m "Hello, [player]!"
    m "You seem awfully chipper!"
    mc "Haha, thanks."
    "Natsuki turns to me like she’s only just now noticed me."
    n "Oh hey, [player]."
    mc "Umm hey, Natsuki,"
    "Sheesh…"
    "She seems a little agro today."
    "Best to steer clear I suppose"
    "Without warning Sayori and Yuri walk in simultaneously."
    s "Hey guys!!!"
    y "Good afternoon, everyone."

    "After everyone has greeted each other, we get on to doing our respective activities."
    "I was gonna talk to Sayori, but it seems like she’s preoccupied talking to Yuri about perfumes…"
    "Not gonna lie, didn’t see that coming."
    mc "God, I’m lucky to have her."
    "I whisper that quietly to myself."
    "I should write a poem about her."
    m "You doing okay, [player]?"
    mc "Ah!"
    "I was so stuck daydreaming I didn’t notice Monika sneaking up on me."
    mc "Yeah I’m fine thanks…"
    "Monika chuckles."
    m "Try blinking!"
    m "Aha, I’m just kidding."
    m "But Sayori would probably be a little uncomfortable if she noticed you staring like that."
    mc "You make a good point."
    "You know, maybe it’s okay to talk to Monika about Sayori and I."
    "I mean she’s Sayori’s best friend."
    "And probably the most trustworthy person in the club."
    mc "Well you see it’s just…"
    m "Mhmm?"
    mc "Sayori and I went on a date last night and, well it was really good."
    mc "She had perfume, and nice clothes as well."
    mc "Like she really put in a lot of effort."
    mc " I suppose I’m just so proud of her, you know?"
    "Monika laughs softly."
    m "You know, [player]..."
    m "That is the most adorable thing I’ve ever heard."
    m "Hehe~!"
    m "I’ll let you in on a little secret…"
    m "I’ve been giving Sayori tips on dating and fashion." 
    m "I’ve even lent her a few clothes to try out…"
    "That explains the ‘help’ Sayori referred to earlier."
    m "She’s not too good at returning stuff you know."
    mc "How so?"
    m "Well, I once let her borrow this really nice jacket from me."
    m "It was a varsity jacket of mine."
    m "She’s probably forgotten about it by now, hehe."
    m "It really suited her, but I’m unsure as to whether she would actually wear it."
    mc "Huh…"
    "A varsity Jacket… like the one she wore last night?"
    "Monika would be a slightly bigger size to Sayori due to the…"
    "Chest area…"
    "And the one from last night was slightly too big for her…"
    mc "Monika, I don’t think that Sayori forgot about the jacket…"
    m "What makes you say that?"
    mc "I think she wore it on our date last night." 
    "I send Monika a picture of Sayori from the night before"
    m "Ahh…"
    m "That’s the one,"
    m "This might be a little awkward but..."
    m "n-no I can’t really ask for it back, can I…?"
    m "I mean I would love it back, but I don’t think that would be fair."
    mc "I can ask for it back if you want, Monika."
    m "I suppose it’s up to you."
    m "I won’t stop you, but it was your idea."

    # Writers note: There will be a choice here when the script is completed, but due to the complexity of writing an arguement that would likely involve all the club members I’m gonna have to ask for some help with that, so this draft is the version  where mc doesn’t confront sayori.

            Mc "Alright. Call me if you want to come over and study at my house."
            "Sayori’s already halfway down the street and I hear a quiet \"okay\""
            "I sigh and open my door, heading inside."
